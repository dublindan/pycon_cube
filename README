Pycon Ireland 2010 try out on solving Bedlam's cube

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedlam_cube

Target data representation for the search: a list of 13 lists of 64-bit
integers:

[
  0b000000110010 (...) 010, # 1st piece
  0b000001100010 (...) 010, # 2nd piece
  ...
                      # 13th piece
]

...or a list of 13 lists of 64 numbers, where each number is 0 or 1.

[
  [0, 1, 1, ..., 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 1, ..., 0, 0],
  ...
]

A solution can be represented as a list of 13 numbers, indexes of the
input lists.
